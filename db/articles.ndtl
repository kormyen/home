    p {image 2017-11-05_17-53 il} Sailing myself was not really even a consideration until I started watching the Hundred Rabbits {link ext studioSailboat} vlogs where they seemed to go quickly from zero sailing experience to international travel.
    p I met Devine and Rekka and their boat Pino in Whangarei after they sailed to New Zealand from California. 
    p {link ext pino} is a 10 meter Yamaha33 1982 masthead sloop fiberglass sailboat.
    p Devine introduced me to a shared workshop and tool library called "Hackland" in Auckland and thus to it's expanding Ephemeral Yacht Club including {link ext joranKikke}, Helena, {link ext dominic}, Courtney and Lu.

    p Around this time the same Aunt Karen asked me if I plan to sail, I said "no, the ocean is scary" or something similarly dismissive in response but her question stayed with me.
    p My vanlife experiences let me see that tiny homes are perfectly acceptable. A sense of adventure and becoming a "sum of those closest to you" nudged me toward actually deciding to "learn how to sail in the future"... "I'll buy a boat in five years".
    p While working on {link project sylo} I became good friends with Sasha who was very keen to learn sailing. I introduced him to {link ext joranKikke 'Joran'} and {link ext dominic 'Dominic'}.

    p My now close friend {link ext dominic 'Dominic Tarr'} offered to give Sasha and I a sailing lesson. He later told me that he knew his track record of sailing students converting to sailboat owners is a high percentage... I agreed to a day sail.
    p {link ext dominic 'Dominic'} describes himself as a "cyberhobo" and is probably the most interesting person I know. He very much {link ext magicians 'looks like a magician'} to me. I very much appreciate his teaching, patience and stories.

    p We slowly sailed to Browns Island from Mission Bay. We swam ashore and hiked the small Windows XP landscape, enjoying the 360 degree view of Auckland city, Rangitoto Island and the Hauraki Gulf. It's feels as if it is very literally a picnic island.

    p We decided that instead of sailing back, we would sail to Waiheke Island stay a night and sail home in the morning.
    p The two day lesson gave Sasha and I a good all round taste from low wind sailing, sunny windy sailing, and strong wind rainy sailing.
    i 2019-01-20_12-00
    p Sasha eventually convinced me over several weeks "why wait, sail now" - to split the costs of a yacht and learn together.
    p I do not regret learning to sail what so ever.
    p It sounds clich√© but once I started sailing around Auckland's Gulf Harbour I finally understood Auckland's "City of Sails" motto. 
    p It is stunningly beautiful.

    p Sailing her to Auckland from Jamieson Bay was our first mission. An eight hour sail.
    i 2019-03-02_07-34
    p We did a couple of small test sails on days prior, to build our confidence and be able to quickly turn back if anything went wrong.
    p On our first attempt we got all the way into the Hauraki Gulf over half way before the waves and wind picked up more than we were comfortable dealing with. Being blown around (too much sail), with fairly large waves.

    p We kept Quest on a mooring in Stanley bay which we thought was an amazing location. It turns out to be a terrible location. Rocky with harbour waves and constant passing boat wakes. Completely unsuitable for doing anything other than leaving immediately. We have since moved Quest to a calm pile mooring in Panmure.

    p My friend Sasha and I actually only owned Quest {link post quest 'Quest'} around a week before Horizon's Trademe auction ended and we purchased her for a cheap price... because she had a leak!
    p The photo below is the first and what we thought the last time we saw Horizon. We expected her to be much more expensive.
    p Horizon's leak had stopped after sitting on her new mooring home for a while so we thought we might have got away with a crazy deal. It wasn't until sailing to Great Barrier Island one time and hearing the bilge pumps going that we thought we might be in deeper than we hoped. We ended up being totally fine, with only a slow weep. We learned a whole lot going through the process of fixing the leak with a lot of help from many ath the Panmure Yacht and Boating club.

    p PROGRESSION: A sense of progression. Same base loop but progression. Feels rewarding.
    p Eg: Upgrades after waves. Getting better high scores. Running track faster than last time. Running further.
    p Eg: Running. Base look is moving legs, feels fun to go fast. Progression feels rewarding - getting better, faster over years of practice.

    p Between 2018-07-12 and 2018-12-31 I logged 937 hours, tracked over 181 days, meaning 5.2 hours of output per day on average, or 36.4 hours per week averaged out.
    p 76% of days were vegetarian.
    p 7% of days were in nature.
    p 28% of days we social.
    p 15% of days included exercise.
    p Sector split: code (244h), visual (242h), carpentry (179h), physical (133h), electronics (80h), research (53h) and misc (6h).
    p The majority of work was dedicated to Van (32%), Contract (26%) and Web (23%) categories.
    p The biggest projects were {link project sylo} (248h), {link project memex} (154h), {link project bench} (105h), {link project solar} (85h),  {link project log} (51h), {link project garage} (46h), {link project insulation} (45h), {link project core} (34h), {link project crucifix} (28h), {link project fan} (25h) and {link project megamex} (21h).
    3 Logging Benefits
    p The gamified mental nagging to keep or improve desired statistics over time helped me to keep work hours higher and meat consumption lower.
    p A benefit of entering logs regularly is the recognition of passing time. As opposed to the feeling of blurred days, weeks, months.
    p Viewing the dashboard statistics is satisfying. Like quantification, acknowledgment of long-term desirable time use.
    2 Improvements
    3 Simplification
    p Too many statistics tracked means adding logs takes more effort than needed, and thus is more likely to procrastinate and skip. The 'Flow' field ("Did I enter a flow state?") is not all that useful and will be removed. More stats should be removed...
    3 Vege gaming
    p I am finding that binary vegetarian/omnivore logging encourages increased meat consumption during a non-vegetarian-day since there is no log difference between a single portion vs gluttony. I will change the binary switch to a meat-portion-count per entry.
    3 Feelings
    p I have a nagging feeling that percentage values for 'mood', 'health' and 'energy' do not feel they adequately represent 'feeling', but I am not sure how useful that is to track long term. I could add a word each day for feeling but not sure that the added effort it would add for logs match the benefit. Even a word obviously won't be adequate for representing contradictory or multiplistic feelings.
    3 Better vis and insights
    p Need visualization for social, exercise days and better visualization for sectors, difficulty, efficiency, interest, learned, mood, health, energy. Probably an averaged line graph with scatter points. Adding combined stats (like Neauoire) as comparisons between sectors, categories and or projects could lead to insights.
    3 Phone log access
    p Since I have been working in Auckland and living in van I have not been using my laptop everyday, which is currently the sole logging station. I've ended up not logging for several days, then having to catch up - the longest stretch being 11 days. I did not miss any important data but this is not a good habit. Would be nice to have a simple way to append to log from my phone.
    3 Date system change
    p I much prefer Neauoire's Desamber date system but it makes things take a step extra for working things out. In an effort to reduce complexity I will change to a more standard date format. Eg: "2019-01-01". I still intend to use Desamber display on the front end.
    3 Image tags
    p Change image inclusion to format like Megamex with separate file for images with tags. Add names of people in photo etc.
    3 Split
    p It could make sense for this logging system to be split into two systems for example 'output' (concrete work) and 'input' (social activities, intake and self improvement).
    3 Considerations:
    p Track takeout meals
    p Track alcohol
    p Track fruit/vege portions
    p Track gym visits
    p Track meditation

    p To call it "awesome" is the wrong word. Its relaxing, weightless, nothingness, surreal.
    p It was funny going in, at the counter were two mid 20s Russian dudes and a trainee lady. Seemed like the whole time there was an unspoken joke in the room. "How did you hear about isolation tanks?", "The internet..." "Joe Rogan?" "Probably".
    p They said they owe of lot of business to him. 
    p The explanation of instructions was also funny as I had already watched quite a few isolation tank guides / do / don'ts. He covered every remaining question I had left, so didn't ask anything.
    p He explained three floats are better as most people spend the first one just getting used to it. Beyond just up-selling he was probably correct. I'd recommend any "introduction package" of three or so too.
    p Everything was spa / new age / massage parlor relaxation center-eske in the room. "You don't need to bring anything. Everything you need is here." Completely private room with the giant alien space pod tank, a shower, toilet, basin, cleaning products, towel. Needed to shower, wash hair, cover cuts, and wear ear plugs.
    p Getting in was uncomfortable. Voluntary naked bathing in claustrophobic alien womb. 
    p The water was salty. Very salty. 
    p I turned off the light.
    p It took a while to find a comfortable position. It took a while for the air to heat up and disappear between the surface and salt.
    p It was a good place to think. I know the intention, or at least mine was to "be here now", to be silent but the nothingness was peaceful. I reflected, meditated as such. Thought about about life, about the last weeks, months years. How things are going with me, and the others around me.
    p It was easy to imagine and visualize.
    p There were visuals if you wanted them, the waves of closed eyes. Inner and intentional it felt like, but perhaps not.
    p I counted breaths and played in this space of waves and silence for what felt like not enough time.
    p I'd love to have a tank at home to meditate and relax in for longer periods of time.
    p Too soon the bird-song-wave-breeze-music vibrated through the water to signal the time is up. 
    p The experience was slightly disappointing but amazing, uncomfortable but incredibly relaxing.
    p I want to do it again soon.

    p 
    q "How important is the perceived need that this design is addressing? 
    q Is it really a need? 
    q If so, what is the simplest way in which it can be met? 
    q What are the trade-offs between simplicity of design and convenience of use?
    q Does the form of a design reflect its function in an aesthetically pleasing way? 
    q Does the design address the need in ways that tend to make my life more free or more encumbered? 
    q More integrated with the local environment or less so? 
    q What is the environmental and economic and social justice impact of the materials used?

    p "VR has the potential to be one of the biggest platform shifts ever and you can be on the leading edge of that." - {link ext vrShift}
    p With the sense of ‚Äúpresence‚Äù in the virtual world, interacting with another person brings a new level of connection and wonder in virtual space.
    p "Multiplayer is amazing in VR" - {link ext palmerLucky}
    p Forget uncanny valley for a moment, ignore the dreary march toward realism, even just mapping positional movement and rotation of a person‚Äôs head is distinctly, recognizably human. Two cubes (players) are able to tell that they are both human, interact and communicate with just that alone.
    i 2014-06-11_00-02
    p Above comic panel from {link ext understandComics}.
    p Non-default communication systems that encourage, emotional expression, the emergence of new, player created, in-game languages and efficient co-operative and competitive ‚Äì sometimes deceptive ‚Äì communicative behavior have a massive potential.
    p Exploring imaginative worlds together with friends, *actual* ‚Äúsocial‚Äù games with the "presence" of each other will be amazing.
    p The Facebook purchase was a stomach drop, an unexpected sour taste. It could have been inevitable and unavoidable since the venture capital relationship. We can look on the bright side with the increased chance of mass adoption, lower cost of product, easier R&D. The thought that if VR is what we hope, if Oculus succeeds beyond what we expect, knowing a company like Facebook is leading things is just heart breaking.
    p - Competition is good.
    p - VR is not Oculus.
    p - Oculus is VR.
    i 2014-06-11_00-03
    p Sony‚Äôs Project Morpheus is a massive win. They have the ability to bring VR to the mainstream, push innovation, make things ‚Äújust work‚Äù for the consumer. Long term though, I do have a lot of concerns for them.
    p "First VR hardware is going to evolve rapidly on the PC as you can already see happening with the Rift. While the consoles, if they even support VR will remain static for years. Second, there are going to be far more hardware and software developers figuring out how to do awesome VR on the PC than on the consoles, and they will be much free-er to experiment. Third, VR needs as much processing power as it can get, remember we are talking about stereo rendering at 95 hertz, and a high end PC is already much more powerful than consoles, with the gap due to increase for years to come. And because of power and heat constraints PCs will always be far more powerful than mobile." - {link ext vrEvolve}
    p {link ext sonyPsVr 'Sony are extremely inspiring in that they seem to have the right mindset.'}
    p - ‚ÄúVR is a medium, not a peripheral
    p - *Presence is the killer app*
    p - Games are only one type of content
    p - Emotion is amplified
    p - The experience is social
    p - It is for everyone‚Äù
    p ‚Äú...so that when NASA makes it to a new place, people with PS4 at home can feel like they‚Äôre right with them.‚Äù
    p Hardware limits push for less focus on graphics. *Presence is priority*. Where once we expected to be more than happy with head tracking and screens in front of our eyes, we realize we need perfection like never before. Lag means motion sickness. Unintended movements, bad calibration, camera jumps are actually physically bad. Resolution so close to your eyes so obviously needs increasing.
    p "The key to presence is convincing perceptual systems that operate at a low level, well below our conscious awareness that they are perceiving reality." - {link ext vrPresence}
    p "Immersion means you feel surrounded by the virtual world. Presence means you feel in, the virtual world." - {link ext vrImmersion}
    p "Trying to describe presence is bound to come up short. You can only really understand it by experiencing it but I will give it a shot. Presence is when; even though you know you‚Äôre in a demo room and there is nothing really there, you can‚Äôt help reaching out to try to touch a cube. When you automatically duck your head to avoid a pipe that is dangling from the ceiling. When you feel uneasy because there is a huge block hanging over your head. When your unwilling to step off a ledge. Its taking off the head mounted display and being disoriented to find yourself back in reality. Its more than just looking at some place interesting, its flipping the switch that makes you believe, deep in your lizard brain, that you are some place interesting. Presence is one of the most powerful experiences you can have outside reality precisely because it operates by engaging along many of the same channels as reality. For many people presence is simply magic." - {link ext vrDescribe}
    p Just watch Michael Abrash‚Äôs {link ext vrCouldShouldWill 'What VR Could, Should, and Almost Certainly Will Be within Two Years'}

    p The good news is, the technology is nearly ready.
    p The exciting thing is that lot still to learn.
    p There seems to be a push for ‚Äú360 degree video‚Äù, which sounds cool but I have a lot of concerns‚Ä¶ The majority of motion sickness comes from your brain believing its actually moving in virtual space, but it receiving contradictory physical stimulus ‚Äì the opposite reasoning but same effect as car sickness.
    p *‚ÄúKinesthetic dissonance‚Äù*
    p "‚Ä¶then there‚Äôs one huge change in our vision that occurs every few seconds that causes everything to be black: blinking. Luckily, our brain is quite smart and ignores the lack of signals from our eyes when we blink so we never notice our vision getting obscured by our eyelids. Likewise, when you turn your head, it never seems like the quick panning blur effect in movies because your brain knows that your complete vision will be shifting. It ignores a lot of the visual data when your head is moving and it prepares to show you new information once your head has stopped. If there is any disconnect between the motion you feel and the motion you see, your brain can get confused and this is the main cause of motion sickness." - {link ext vrEyeFramerate}
    p If an actor, or camera man is jumping around, running or moving where you don‚Äôt intend; it could be bad. There are things to work out...
    p "Motion sickness or kinetosis, also known as travel sickness, is a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system‚Äôs sense of movement. Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness." - {link ext wikiMotionSick}
    p Virtual cinema screens while seemingly unimaginative, could actually be amazing in certain situations like for long plane trips. Feel as though you have left your cramped seat and escape to a complete virtual cinema just for you.
    p Virtual School trips to the actual places of study. Virtual reality educational experiences.

    p I think there is a big potential for {link thought neurotech} integration. You already have something on your head anyway, why not seamlessly introduce biometrics and brainwave monitoring?

    p Dmitry Selitskiy from Thought Wired showed us some sweet Neurotech.
    i 2014-04-12_00-03
    p See Alexey in the GIF moving the cube on the screen with his thoughts.
    p The experience is clumsy but it does work! Awesome to see.
    p Currently training the user is an issue. Its a perfect UX design opportunity and a lot of game potential for a seamless training experience that adapts to the user. Ideally the user would learn through doing, while at the same time the system would be looking for thought pattern in the background.

    p Psychonauts training school VR!?
    p 
    p Dmitry said the main applications currently are about control, monitoring and determining mental state.
    p He said that there are two real user groups of neurotech ‚Äì complete beginners and experts. First time users would really need complete training from the basics ideally from within the app if you‚Äôre building one.
    p 
    p Neurotech seems to be in a similar boat to VR in terms of mass adoption and development. However it has a bit of a more difficult a task with its slower time before the user can do what they intend. The user needs to learn how to use the hardware while at the same time the hardware needs to learn the user‚Äôs brainwave patterns.
    p 
    p There isn‚Äôt really any formalized good practice around developing for it, and no real platform to abstract away dealing with the different hardware ‚Äì which is exactly what Thought-Wired are working on.
    p 
    p Definitely check it out if you get a chance!
    p I don‚Äôt think its a question of ‚Äúif‚Äù this technology will be widely used, its a question of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù and what it will look like then.
    p 
    p Looking forward to seeing this technology, and Thought-Wired‚Äôs platform develop.

    p 
    p I wrote this a couple of weeks after Journey released, but didn‚Äôt post this anywhere until now Nov 2012. 
    p These are my opinions and thoughts on Journey. 
    p Warning: **SPOILERS!**

    p 
    p To me Journey is an experience that cannot be put into words but I will try anyway!
    p I love this game.
    p The human element makes it what it is. Every person you meet is different. Every action and reaction. The bonds and experiences, or lack there of. All with someone you don‚Äôt even know the name of. Every journey is different because of the human element.
    p - Discovering how to fly forever together for the first time. I cannot explain how this felt, we celebrated in the sky.
    p - Trying to teach someone to fly forever the first time was a massive struggle, trying to communicate how with such a limited and mis-interpretable language. I decided I was determined to teach this companion. The moment they understood, and we could fly though the dessert celebrating was intense. Most rewarding experience in gaming I have ever had.
    p - Realizing the other was trying to draw something in the snow‚Ä¶ a heart. Amazing. Then co-op heart chain drawing our way to the light, hilarious.
    p - Celebration dancing, singing and meditation in the final climb. Game chills.
    p - Being wrapped in a companions scarf. Heartwarming.
    p - The language. Learning to speak to each other. Beginning with associating sound patterns with certain actions. Advancing from there. Very very simple of course (yes, no, come here, look look look look, thanks‚Ä¶), context based and body language dependant, but a shared language none the less. It‚Äôs amazing when someone begins to understand and starts chirping intelligently back.
    p - The game design is clever, amazing, level and world design inspiring, sound design subliminally and consciously beautiful, visual style breathtaking, story open and deep, an experience of emotional peaks and pitfalls. A masterpiece.

    p My current perception of the story of the world of Journey:
    
    p - {link ext journeyCinematic 'In the beginning there was peace, energy and balance'}.
    p - Life came to the land.
    p - They learned how to harvest the ‚Äúcloth‚Äù energy.
    p - They built a civilization on this energy.
    p - ‚ÄúHarvesting‚Äù more and more.
    p - {link ext journeyCinematic2 'A war started over this power struggle of energy between two factions of the white ones'}.
    p - They created powerful weapons of destruction
    p - They battled, and destroyed everything.
    p - Many passed.
    p - The great civilization was lost.
    p - The hero‚Äôs journey begins.
    p - New hope in a land of regret.

    p {link ext journeyManiac}
    p 
    p A cycle of energy. ‚ÄúEverything is made from the same energy.‚Äù The cloth energy. The white ones are a visualization of the true form, at peace in the light of the mountain. The white ones are the red avatars evolution. The red avatars are formed from the cloth energy, by collecting glyphs - other avatars, other energy you merge and journey together. The cloth creatures are the red characters afterlife. The red characters are the light glyphs (at the ‚Äúend‚Äù you shoot out and return to beginning in the form of a gylph). The light glyphs are the white light. The white light is made of the white mist. The white mist at the end is your voice - your symbol when you ‚Äúsing‚Äù, the energy. The white mist is the snow. The snow is the sand. The buildings are made from compacted sand and stone. Everything is made of the same energy. The buildings are tombs for the dead (repurposed or built for?). When people die, they turn into the living cloth creatures. The more influence, the more spiritual power they had when they died the bigger the cloth creature they will be. (Example: See the whale‚Äôs tomb in the tower; the picto-glyph depicts a funeral of a person of importance. The glyph states the tombs purpose. The tomb is the funeral ceremony room depicted. The whale‚Äôs origin is this tomb. The whale is the king‚Äôs new form.). The war leviathans are transformed armored cloth whales, or powered by cloth energy. The houses / the ‚Äúcover‚Äù / cages throughout the game are fallen leviathan remains. By singing you rescue the magic carpets and cloth cards from being trapped within.

    p Cloth. Creature. Walker. Rock. Sand. Building. Dust. Snow. Voice. Energy. Glowing symbols. White one.
    p Red to white.
    p Six levels. Six totems at the end of levels. Six white ones.
    p Short game length - ‚ÄúLife is short‚Äù. You lose your cloak at the end - ‚ÄúIn the end material wealth means nothing‚Äù. No glorified extravagant ending cut scene - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the journey, not the destination.‚Äù
    p Thatgamecompany‚Äôs evolution through the games - flow (micro organism, water), flower (organic life, nature, grass, wind, earth, city), journey (bipedal being, sand, life, companion, transcendence).
    i 2012-11-17_00-08
    p It could be said that Journey contains symbolism from probably all spiritual belief systems. Tombs, remembrance, influence in the afterlife, heaven, angels, judgement, ascension, reincarnation, cycle, karma,  oneness.
    p Many metaphors, references and experiences can be perceived. {link ext journeyLifetime}, outward views of the human race, perils of technology, animal testing, war commentary, {link ext journeyHero}, {link ext journeyLost}, {link ext journeyRebirth}, {link ext journeyAfterlife}, warnings, religion, enlightenment, companionship, love, {link ext journeyFert}, universal appeal - {link ext journeyUniversal 'peace, children, innocence, nature, love, the sense of flight'}.

    p The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created a date and time standard called "ISO 8601" it defines the date to be represented as YYYY-MM-DD.
    p I have personally used (most often with builds or photo folders etc) a similar format YYYYMMDD or YYYY_MM_DD as it orders in correct chronological order in "alphabetical sorting" (default file browser behavior).
